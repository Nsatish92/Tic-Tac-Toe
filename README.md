# Tic-Tac-Toe
Description: The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns placing their mark (either "X" or "O") on the grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the squares are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a tie.

Steps to create the game:

Create a 3x3 array to represent the game board.
Create a Scanner object to get input from the user.
Use a loop to alternate between the two players, allowing each player to place their mark on the board.
For each player's turn, prompt them to enter the row and column where they want to place their mark.
Check if the move is valid (i.e. the square is not already occupied) and update the board accordingly.
After each move, check if the game has been won or if the board is full (in which case the game is a tie).
If the game has been won or is a tie, end the game and display the result.
Ask the players if they want to play again.
